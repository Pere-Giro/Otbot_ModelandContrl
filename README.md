# Otbot_ModelandContrl
This is the work done during my intership in "Institut de Robòtica i Informàtica Industrial" from June 2020 to May 2021. The repository includes the pdf document of my thesis explaining in great detail all the work done along with all the Matlab code generated.

# Otbot_models
This folder includes the Matlab .mlx files used to work with its symbolic toolbox to obtain the kinematic and dynamic models of the robot. The .mlx files have also been saved in different formats such as .html, .pdf or .docx for easy reading on any platform outside Matlab. This folder also contains .pdf documents with the dynamic and kinematic model matrices written in a separate text editor, in order to visualise their structure in a cleaner and more orderly way.

# Source_code
This folder contains all the Matlab code used to perform the simulations and is divided into two subfolders Sim_Otbot which contains the kinematic and dynamic simulations to validate the mathematical models together with all the control part. And the subfolder Model_Identification with the simulations and the code used to perform the parameter identification experiments.

Both folders contain in an ordered way the results obtained in each tested case.
