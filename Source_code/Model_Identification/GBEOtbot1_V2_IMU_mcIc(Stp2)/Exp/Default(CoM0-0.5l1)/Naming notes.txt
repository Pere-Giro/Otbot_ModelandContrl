Due to the fact that some of the name folders are too long, there has been made a naming equivalence. 
So take into account that NFDNPFD == NFND

Cte_T(#1,#2,#3) == Constant Torques of values #1 right wheel, #2 left wheel, #3 pivot joint

SqSig == Square signal with duty cicle 50% and from the first parenthesis number to the second (fNumber,sNumber)

SineSig#1_#2 == Sinusoidal signals of amplitude #1, with and offset of #2

#DNoise == Data used has noise in # of 3 sampling data. 
	DNoise --> The noise is result of the formula sdv = ND*sqrt(SR)

#HNoise == Data used has noise in # of 3 sampling data. 
	HNoise --> The noise is higher than the one obtined with the formula sdv = ND*sqrt(SR); sdvH = sdv + somevalue

[# - #] == Are the periods of time of sampling and the zoh holding time respectiveliy
	* If only 1 number inside [#] --> Equal periods of sampling

WR --> Wrong reality, this means that the parameters I_b_new, x_G_new, y_G_new 
	(which reality value needs to be recomputed to apply properly the trick I_t=0; m_w=0, are not properly computed.
	 instead of using the mathematiclay presice expresions for this parameters a simple aproximation is used and so thier
	 real values are not real, but an aproximation of the real ones)
	The simpler expressions used are:
	I_b_new = I_b + 2*I_t;
	m_b_new = m_b + 2*m_w; --> This is the one that is correct. (The masses can be summed directly no problem)
	x_G_new = x_G;
	y_G_new = y_G; --> This one is also correct but due to the facte that C.O.M is placed over the simetry axis of Otbot, in a more general case needs to be recomputed.
